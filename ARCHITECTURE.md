# Architecture

This document describes the high-level architecture of the FindingATime web application.
If you want to familiarize yourself with the code base, you are in the right place!


## Constraints

The current webapp is built under the design philosophy of lowest friction.  There are no login requirements requiring sign up.
Instead UUIDs are generated per browser user and store in local storage and in the remote database to create events and to add availability by invitees to those events. 



## Bird's Eye View

Users of Finding A Time have a general flow the site supports today:
- event creators come to the site and use the create-event page to fill out event details and their availability
```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    Actor Creator
    Creator ->> CreateEvent Page : Navigate to Create Event Page from Landing Page
    Creator ->> CreateEvent Page : Create event with event details
    Creator ->> CreateEvent Page : Enter Username
    CreateEvent Page ->> CreateEvent Page: Store Username locally
    Creator ->> CreateEvent Page : Add their own availability
    CreateEvent Page ->> DB: Create User
    CreateEvent Page ->> DB: Create Event
    CreateEvent Page ->> DB: Create Attendee information
    CreateEvent Page ->> Creator :  Redirect to ViewEvent Page
```
- they are provided with a link to the event they can distribute via any medium that allows for others to add their availability
```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    Actor Invitee
    Actor Creator
    Creator ->> ViewEvent Page: Visit Event Page for Created Event
    ViewEvent Page ->> ViewEvent Page: Store Latest Visit Time in Local Storage
    ViewEvent Page ->> DB: Retrieve Event information
    ViewEvent Page ->> DB: Retrieve Attendee information
    Creator ->> ViewEvent Page: Click "Copy Link" button
    Creator ->> Invitee: Share link to ViewEvent Page
```
- invitees that visit the link are taken to the view-event page where they may add their own availability
```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    Actor Invitee
    Actor Creator
    Invitee ->> ViewEvent Page: Visit Link provided by Creator
    ViewEvent Page ->> ViewEvent Page: Store Latest Visit Time in Local Storage
    ViewEvent Page ->> DB: Retrieve Event information
    ViewEvent Page ->> DB: Retrieve Attendee information
    Invitee ->> ViewEvent Page: Enter Username
    ViewEvent Page ->> ViewEvent Page: Store Username locally
    ViewEvent Page ->> DB: Create User
    Invitee ->> ViewEvent Page: Add their availability
    ViewEvent Page ->> DB: Create Attendee information
```
- creators can revist the view event page to gather availability for all invitees
```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    Actor Creator
    Creator ->> ViewEvent Page: Visit View Event Page
    ViewEvent Page ->> ViewEvent Page: Store Latest Visit Time in Local Storage
    ViewEvent Page ->> DB: Retrieve Event information
    ViewEvent Page ->> DB: Retrieve Attendee information
    Creator ->> ViewEvent Page: Review Attendee availability
    Creator ->> Creator: Choose a time that works for all attendees
```
- event creators and invitees who visit the home dashboard page can see events they have created
```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    Actor Creator
    Creator ->> Home Dashboard Page: Visit Home Dashboard Page
    Home Dashboard Page ->> Home Dashboard Page: Retrieve User ID from Local Storage
    Home Dashboard Page ->> DB: Retrieve Events created by User ID and Events User ID submitted Availability for
    Home Dashboard Page ->> Home Dashboard Page: Load from Local Storage all Event visit times
    Home Dashboard Page ->> Creator: Display list of Created Events and recently Visited Events

```

## Code Map

This section talks briefly about various important directories and data structures.
```
src
├── app
│   ├── api                     # API calls that interact with Supabase
│   ├── create-event            # Page for creating new events
│   ├── home                    # Home dashboard view
│   └── page.tsx                # Landing page
├── components                  # React components core to the website like (Header.tsx, EventCard.tsx, etc)
├── utils                       # Common utils used by components and api's for data structure manipulation
├── tailwind.config.js          # Configure tailwind CSS and DaisyUI
└── .env.example                # Configuration file for setting up local build
```

### Supabase

Database migrations can be found in this [folder](supabase/migrations/).  You can find the schema definition for core tables like  `Users`, `Events` and `Attendees` there.

The `seed.sql` file that seeds the database post `supabase db reset` can be found here [folder](supabase/seed.sql).

### Local Tools

Husky is called via precommit hooks and can be found [here](.husky/pre-commit) with the bulk of validation in this [shell file](.husky/_/husky.sh)

### GitHub CI

GitHub Actions are used for validating PRs for readiness to merge into `main` and can be found [here](.github/workflows/pull-request.yaml)


## Deployment

The findingatime.com website is deployed to CloudFlare Pages linked to a Supabase.com project.
The following configurations were used for deployments on CloudFlare:
```
Build command: npx @cloudflare/next-on-pages@1
Build output directory: /.vercel/output/static
Root directory: /
Build comments on pull requests: Enabled
```

The following environment variables were set for each deployment environment:
```
HOST_URL = findingatime.com
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY = <your supabase anon key>
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL = <your supabase app url>
NODE_VERSION = 19.3.0
```
